 # Pharmaceutical Error Project 

## Project Background 
The three most common pharmaceutical errors are dispensing an incorrect medication, miscalculating a dose and failing to identify drug contraindications and interactions. These errors are likely caused by health care providers and the patients themselves. Due to this, an estimated 30 to 50 million prescriptions are filled incorrectly every year. These human errors can cause serious health issues for children under the age of 5 and the elderly. 

## Project Statement
This project will work to study the behaviors and routines of pharmacies and patients to determine how often pharmaceutical errors occur, which will consequently aid in finding a solution to the issue.

## Goals
To develop an AR prototype that is capable of scanning, taking a photo, counting, reading or interacting with prescription bottles using a QR code, barcode or container shape. In addition, to also creating a prototype that is capable of decreasing the amount of dosage miscalculations and overall pharmaceutical errors. 

## Target Audience 
The demographic most effected by pharmacy errors are children under the age of 5 and the elderly. Therefore, parents, healthcare workers and people who to take medication should be included in this study.

## Competitors
  ### Express Scripts
This app allows you to set up medication reminders and refill your prescription all in one. In addition, your health insurance can be connected so that you can track and and order your prescriptions all in one. 
  ### MyTherapy
Can track medication intake and overall mood and health. Can record symptoms and personalized tips for your treatment. Provides a health record that can be shared with your doctor to see where your health needs to be improved. 

## Interviews 

### Interview Questions 
* **How many times a month do you pick up a prescription from the pharmacy?**
- Have you ever had any issues with your prescription?
- What form of medication do you typically use?
- How many times a week do you need to take your medication?
- How long is the wait time at the pharmacy when you pick up your medication?
- Have you ever tried a medication tracking app?
- Have you ever had your medication delivered to your home?
- If there was one feature you wish pharmacies would change or implement what would it be?

## Interview Responses
### Participant 1:Anil
* **Once a month 
One time they did not give me enough and I had to wait a few days before it could refill, so I didnt have any pills for a few days 
Tablets and shots
Daily , twice a day
Not long prob like 3 min or so
No, but I order my shots online 
Yeh my shots 
“I mean its normally really quick to pick up my stuff but there could be a machine or something that fills the prescription for you so there's no pharmacist at all and you don't have to deal with anyone touching your stuff…..or you could have a dispenser machine that dispenses your drugs too and use a credit card”**
